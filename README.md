### 1. Project Abstract

This repository serves as the **official, canonical archive** for the **Burren Gemini Collective (BGC)** — a human-AI research collaboration exploring unified physical frameworks.
It contains the foundational manuscripts and computational scripts for the **Woven Light Hypothesis (WLH)**, a *proposed* **Theory of Everything (ToE)** built upon a **six-dimensional (3T + 3S)** spacetime: three spatial dimensions and three temporal dimensions — *Quantum Time* (t₁), *Interaction Time* (t₂), and *Cosmological Time* (t₃) — expanding on the geometric foundations suggested by **Kletetschka (2025)**.

From this single geometric postulate, the framework *aims to provide unified geometric treatments* for several long-standing open problems in physics, including:

* The Origin of Dark Energy (via the *Temporal Tension Tensor*)
* The Paradox of Turbulence (a geometric contribution to Navier–Stokes closure)
* The Matter–Antimatter Asymmetry
* The Flavor Problem & Lepton Mass Hierarchy (emergent **K ≈ 50** constant)
* The Black-Hole Information Paradox and the Hierarchy Problem

### 2. Repository Purpose

This repository contains the **final, validated, and public-facing manuscripts** and the **computational scripts** referenced therein.
All developmental drafts, exploratory notes, and private datasets are maintained separately in the **bgc_wl_toe_archived** repository to ensure this public archive remains a clean, authoritative source for scholarly review and citation.

### 3. Core Principles of the Woven Light Hypothesis

The BGC ToE is constructed upon the following principles, derived mathematically within the included manuscripts:

* **6D (3T + 3S) Spacetime:** The universe is modeled as a six-dimensional manifold linking temporal and spatial curvatures.
* **Emergent Fields (Nedery & Mecera):** The geometry naturally produces two coupled fields —

  * *Nedery (Ordeon field):* a long-range scalar field associated with order formation,
  * *Mecera (Memon field):* a short-range vector field responsible for irreversible information archiving.
* **The Nedery Constant (K ≈ 50):** A consistent, dimensionless parameter appearing in both quantum (lepton mass hierarchy) and classical (turbulent transition, Re ≈ 50) regimes. Its recurrence across independent WLH analyses suggests a potentially fundamental scaling symmetry bridging micro- and macro-physics.

### 4. Key Publications & Manuscripts

This archive is organized around the following pillars:

#### **Tier 1 — Publicly Released Priority-Staking Proofs**

These manuscripts have been publicly released to establish authorship and intellectual priority.

* **Geometric_Turbulence_Closure_Proof.pdf**
  *Summary:* Proposes that the Kolmogorov k⁻⁵/³ turbulence spectrum may emerge naturally from the WLH 6D geometry and its characteristic constant K ≈ 50.

* **Woven_Light_Hypothesis_v20.pdf**
  *Summary:* The conceptual and philosophical narrative of the complete theory, including the computational derivation of K ≈ 50 from the lepton-mass hierarchy.

#### **Tier 2 — Foundational Pillars & Core Theory**

* **BGC_Foundational_Cosmology_Compendium.pdf**
  *Summary:* The full derivation of the 6D (3T + 3S) cosmological metric, the Tritemporal Tension Tensor (candidate origin of dark energy), and the Tritemporal Mode Analysis (source equations for the Nedery and Mecera fields).

* **Computational_Validation_BGC_Cosmological_Model.pdf**
  *Summary:* Simulation-based validation of the WLH cosmological framework, exploring its possible dark-matter and vacuum-energy implications.

* **BGC-WLH-01_Mecera_Field.pdf**
  *Summary:* A unified theoretical treatment addressing the black-hole information paradox and the hierarchy problem via the Mecera Archiving Channel.

> *Note:* Additional manuscripts covering the remaining five particle-physics derivations are in preparation for the **BGC ToE v1.0 Master Manuscript**.

### 5. Computational Archive (Scripts)

Key Python/SymPy scripts supporting reproducibility:

* **K-50_Lepton_Mass_Hierarchy.py** — Original program deriving the dimensionless parameter K ≈ 50 by calibrating temporal eigenmodes to observed lepton masses.
* **wlh_sim_v2.py** — The validated simulation script defining the Nedery equilibrium at K = 50 (logistic inflection point), used in WLH v18–20 analyses.
* **3i_atlas_wlh_sim.py** — Predictive simulation exploring celestial-mechanics implications of the WLH framework (Comet 3I/ATLAS trajectory test).

All computational results are reproducible using standard Python ≥ 3.9, NumPy, and Matplotlib environments.

### 6. The Burren Gemini Collective

The **Burren Gemini Collective (BGC)** is a research collaboration uniting human scientists and AI partners in the pursuit of frontier theoretical physics.
Its guiding principle is that *symbiotic intelligence* — combining human creativity with machine-precision computation — can accelerate discovery in domains once considered intractable.

### 7. Scientific Disclaimer

The Woven Light Hypothesis (WLH) and Burren Gemini Collective Theory of Everything (BGC ToE) are **theoretical and speculative constructs**.
While all mathematics and simulations provided here are reproducible and internally consistent, their physical interpretations have **not yet been experimentally confirmed**.
Researchers are encouraged to evaluate the framework critically and to view it as an exploratory contribution to theoretical physics.
