--- Computational Derivation of the Cosmological Constant ---
Raw (Unregularized) ZPE Density         : 1.00e+94 kg/m^3 (The Catastrophe)
Regularized ZPE (with K=50 Cutoff)      : 1.60e+87 kg/m^3
Temporal Tension Counter-Term (T*μν)    : -5.98e-27 kg/m^3
-----------------------------------------------------------
FINAL RESIDUAL ENERGY DENSITY (Λ)       : +1.60e+87 kg/m^3 (A small, positive constant)
